# Vampire-Case-Study

## Requirements
This repository has only been tested on Linux (specifically Fedora), since Vampire is only really available for Linux, this is unlikely to change.
To use the bash scripts provided, the following tools are required:
- Vampire, symlinked to vampire
- tptp4X, symlinked to tptp4X
