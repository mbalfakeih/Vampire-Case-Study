# Impossible Folder
This folder contains conjectures that I believe to be correct, but vampire cannot currently prove unless we add them as an axiom. If there is a mistake here feel free to, quite literally, prove me wrong.

Note that the file extension .imp only exists to make the implementation of `prove_properties.sh` easier.
